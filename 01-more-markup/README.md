## More Markup

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

1. Review the content in `more-tags.txt`. You will see a lot of random content. This content is designed to give you a basis for trying a number of new tags. You will see comments throughout the document. These are notes to guide you along. Do not include this content in your page.

2. Create a new document, `more-tags.html` and build a basic document structure within. Be sure to include your doctype, `html`, `head`, `meta`, `title` and `body` tags. Give the page an appropriate title and include an `h1` as well.

3. It's okay to use your book as a guide for this part. Read the description and uses cases for each since there is a lot of nuance when to use and not use certain tags. (The `u` tag is a really excellent example of this.)

  Remember, in some cases you may still need to use paragraphs or list items (and describe them as ordered or unordered) to first describe the content, then "enhance" the content with these new tags we're learning.

4. When you finish marking up the content, go back and give the document an "outline" with proper heading tags which indicate different sections and subsections. Choose heading text as you see fit.

5. [Validate your code](https://validator.w3.org). Make any necessary corrections so the validator returns no warnings or errors.
