Do not create or move any files outside of the `practice-set-02` directory for this exercise!


### Instructions

Instructions for each exercise are included in their respective folder.


### Tips

- **Read the instructions** before beginning work. Understand what you are trying to accomplish before you write one piece of code.

- **Complete one task at a time.** Do not jump ahead. These steps are designed to help you develop a routine for creating a document structure.

- **Keep a checklist.** After you finish a task, check it off. If you need to set the practice aside, you'll know what step to come back to.

- **Track your questions.** If there's something you are unsure of, make a note to yourself in a notebook or using comments in your code. We can address these in class.

- **Be patient.** If you run into a difficult task, try working through the problem. It is okay to take your time. Refer to your notes or book. (Be careful about random sources on the Internet; they may give you bad information.)

If something does not work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in my tags, attributes or values?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Is the file displayed in my browser the same one I am working on (check file names, directory paths)?
- What is the validator telling me?


### Solution

A solution (plus a copy of these files for future practice) for this exercise will be posted by Monday, Sept. 7.
