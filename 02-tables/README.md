## HTML Tables

### Instructions

As you go through each step, check your the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

#### Building a Basic Table

1. Review the content in `weather.txt` and a screenshot of the `weather.png` to see what your table should look like in the end.

2. Create a new document, `coral-gables.html` and build a basic document structure within. Be sure to include your doctype, `html`, `head`, `meta`, `title` and `body` tags. Give the page an appropriate title. Also include an `h1` as seen in the screenshot.

3. Build the table shown in `weather.png`. To better view the table in the browser as you build it, temporarily add the attribute/value `border="1"` in the `table` tag. This will create an outline of the table and cells within.

4. [Validate your code](https://validator.w3.org). What does the validator tell you is wrong? (Even if your code is perfect, it should return at least one error.) Why do you think this makes the HTML invalid? Make any necessary corrections so the validator returns no warnings or errors.

#### Using Row and Column Groups

1. When finished with the basic table above, add row group elements, `thead` and `tbody` (you won't need `tfoot` in this case since there is no footer).

2. Next, add column group elements, `colgroup`.

#### Using `rowspan` and `colspan`

When building a table with rowspan and colspan, it is best to fill each table cell *individually* and completing the full table before "merging" cells. This way it is easier to see which cells next to one another share a data value. From here it becomes easy to see what modifications are necessary! Trying to build a table with `rowspan` and `colspan` from the start will give you a headache!

1. Review the content in `mascots.txt` and a screenshot of the `mascots.png` to see what your table should look like in the end.

2. Create a new document, `mascots.html` and build a basic document structure within. Be sure to include your doctype, `html`, `head`, `meta`, `title` and `body` tags. Give the page an appropriate title. Also include an `h1` as seen in the screenshot.

3. Build the table shown in `mascots.png`. Again, to better view the table, use the attribute/value `border="1"` in the `table` tag. But this time, you'll know to remove it before running it through the validator.

4. Add row group and column group elements.

5. [Validate your code](https://validator.w3.org). Make any necessary corrections so the validator returns no warnings or errors.

**BONUS:** There are a few abbreviations used in this example. When you find one, on first reference, mark it up accordingly!
